Aggregation Framework: it is used to perform or process the data and transform the data in a flexible way. it's like a pipeline that takes in data , performs various operations and outputs the transformed data

  An Aggregation Pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which performs a specific operation on the data. The stages are executed in a sequence such that output of one stage will pass to the input of next stage
  syntax: db.collection.aggregate([{//stage1},{//stage2},...])

  Most Popular Stages:
    i.$match: filters the data according to a condition
    ii. $project : it is use to select only certain fiels to appear in the result._id is default to appear. 1 is true which makes field appear and 0 is false which makes the field disappear
    iii. $sort: sorts the data in ascending or descending order of a certain field. 1 is for ascending, -1 is for descending
    Eg: db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:'jewelery'}},{$project:{title:1,_id:0}},{$sort:{title:1}}])

    iv. $group: groups the data by a specific field and perform aggregation operations on each group

    use aggregate pipe $group and print number of items
    on each category
db.products.aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$category",count:{$count:{}}}},{$sort:{count:1}}])

  we can use aggregate functions such as $count,$sum,Smin,$max,$avg in $group stage

  v. $unwind: unwind is used to split the array of documents into individual documents
    for eg: we have list of customers and each customer have list of orders they did as a array. To split each order from array so that we can group again and find the sum , we will use $unwind
